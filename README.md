# Web-based calculator

A fully functional web-based calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and advanced functions like exponents and square roots, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The calculator leverages **math.js** to handle complex mathematical expressions.

## Features
- **Basic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷).
- **Advanced functions**: Exponents (xʸ), square root (√), sine (sin), and cosine (cos).
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices for usability.
- **Clear button**: Resets the calculator display for new calculations.
- **Real-time evaluation**: Instantly computes the result upon pressing "=".
- **Error handling**: Displays "Error" for invalid input expressions.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Math.js** (for handling mathematical expressions)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Enhanced-Calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.
3. The calculator will be fully functional and ready to use directly in your browser.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional functions such as **logarithmic functions** and **trigonometric identities**.
- Implement a **calculation history** feature to track previous results.
- Add **keyboard input support** to enhance usability.
